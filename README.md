# Instacart Online Online Grocery

## Overview
This repository contains some examples of Python scripts that I used to analyse the customer segmentation of an online grocery store for sales and marketing strategies. I conducted data exploratory and analysis using Python.

## Objective
Analysed sales and customer data, and recommended strategies for better customer segmentation.

Key questions to be answered:
1. When are the busiest days of the week and the busiest hours of the day? On order to fine-tune the advertisement scheduling.
2. When are the particular times of the days that customers spend most on their purchases?
3. There are a lot of products with different price tags. Can you create simpler price range groupings for the products?
4. What are the more popular products?
5. Who are our main customers?
6. What are their spending habits?
7. Are there differences in customer distributions and spending habits between the different geographical regions?

## Data
The Instacart data sets contain 5 files; aisles, departments, order_products, orders, and products. The Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 can be accessed viaÂ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)							
## Tools
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following libraries:
+ Matplotlib: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ Numpy: performing mathematical operations on arrays
+ Pandas: organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data
+ Seaborn: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ SciPy: broader spectrum of scientific tools, algorithms, and functions
