# Data Analysis of Instacart Online Online Grocery Business Using Python

## Introduction
This is a data analysis project for an online grocery store (Instacart) to suggest strategies for better customer segmentation for the sales and marketing teams. I conducted the data exploratory and analysis using Python.

## Objective
Analysis of sales and customer data, and recommend strategies for better customer segmentation.

Key questions to be answered:
1. When are the busiest days of the week and the busiest hours of the day? On order to fine-tune the advertisement scheduling.
2. When are the particular times of the days that customers spend most on their purchases?
3. There are a lot of products with different price tags. Can you create simpler price range groupings for the products?
4. What are the more popular products?
5. Who are our main customers?
6. What are their spending habits?
7. Are there differences in customer distributions and spending habits between the different geographical regions?

The Instacart data sets contain 5 files; aisles, departments, order_products, orders, and products. The Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 can be accessed viaÂ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)							
## Tools
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following libraries:
+ Matplotlib for creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ Numpy for performing mathematical operations on arrays
+ Pandas for for organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data
+ Seaborn or creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ SciPy for a broader spectrum of scientific tools, algorithms, and functions
